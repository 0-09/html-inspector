Pull requests are greatly appreciated and encouraged. However, if you want to get your pull request accepted, it must meet a few minimum requirements:

- **Test files are required**
  If you're adding a new rule you must add a corresponding test. Check out how the built in rules are tested for examples.

- **Your changes must pass JSHint**
  You can run JSHint from the command line via `grunt jshint`.

- **Follow the existing coding style**
  Consistency is key in any project, so any changes should look like the existing code.
